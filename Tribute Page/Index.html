                    <br>
                    Sushant Singh Rajput was born in Patna in the state of Bihar to Krishna Kumar Singh and Usha Singh.
                    His father is a retired technical officer and worked at Bihar State Handloom Corporation in Patna.
                    He was the youngest of five siblings and had the nickname Gulshan. One of his four sisters Mitu
                    Singh was a state-level cricket player. He attended the St. Karen's High School in Patna. His family
                    moved to Delhi following his mother's death in 2002 where Rajput completed his schooling for
                    intermediate studies in Kulachi Hansraj Model School.

                    <br>
                    During his course at the Delhi College of Engineering, Rajput enrolled himself in Shiamak Davar's
                    dance classes. Soon afterward, he also began attending acting classes under the theatre director
                    Barry John. Rajput later stated that he found the experience to be liberating and wanted to continue
                    doing it forever. He featured as a background dancer in the Dhoom Again song of Dhoom 2 and in
                    Aishwarya Rai's performance at the closing ceremony of the 2006 Commonwealth Games. In 2006, he
                    dropped out of his engineering course during his fourth year to begin a career in arts and
                    performance. He moved to Mumbai, took up odd jobs and small roles alongside working in the theatre
                    industry. Rajput eventually joined Nadira Babbar's theatre group called the Ekjute in which he
                    remained for two and a half years.

                    Rajput continued to act in Pavitra Rishta from its first airing in 2009 till his exit in 2011,
                    having played the part of the protagonist of the series for two and a half years at the time of his
                    exit. He had stated that he intended to move to the United States to study filmmaking and had
                    already gained experience behind the scenes in the film Raaz 2, where he was an assistant director.
                    Rajput made a later reappearance in the final episode of Pavitra Rishta in 2014 after gaining
                    critical acclaim in Bollywood.

                    <strong>2015–2018: Dhoni biopic, Raabta and Kedarnath</strong>
                    <br>
                    In 2011, a biopic on the life of the Indian cricket team captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni was conceived
                    by Dhoni's manager, Arun Pandey. The project was initially faced with various difficulties including
                    objections from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and Dhoni's demand for a large
                    royalty.[69][70] On 25 September 2014, Sushant Singh Rajput was announced as the actor who would
                    play the role of Dhoni in the biopic which was titled M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story and directed by
                    Neeraj Pandey.[69][71] The film was centered around the life of the cricketer beginning with his
                    childhood in the city of Ranchi and leading up to the 2011 Cricket World Cup victory for India under
                    his captaincy.

                    <br>
                    During the release of M. S. Dhoni: The Untold Story, Rajput in an interview had stated that he was
                    signed up to do five more films; namely Raabta, Takadum, Chanda Mama Door Ke, another biopic of an
                    athlete and a film produced by Dharma Productions featuring Jacqueline Fernandez. Earlier in 2014,
                    reports had emerged that Rajput was being signed in alongside Alia Bhatt for the starring roles in
                    the largest budget production of the producer–directors Homi Adajania and Dinesh Vijan.

                    <br>
                    The second biopic that Rajput was to feature in was tentatively titled as Murli: The Unsung Hero,
                    where he would play the role of the disabled jawan turned Paralympics gold medalist Murlikant
                    Petkar. In June 2016, Rajput along with Parineeti Chopra and Irrfan Khan were also announced as the
                    lead of the Adajania directed film called Takadum with shooting scheduled to begin in October but
                    the project was being put on hold due to issues related to script re-adaptation. Meanwhile, the
                    announcement of Rajput's role in Chanda Mama Door Ke had come in September 2016. In the film which
                    was to be directed by Sanjay Puran Singh, Rajput would have starred alongside Nawazuddin Siddiqui
                    and R. Madhavan and was cast in the role of an astronaut, for which he was even sent to NASA on a
                    training module in 2017.

                    He was also cast as the lead in the spy thriller film Romeo Akbar Walter in 2017, however he quit
                    the project in the same year reportedly causing displeasure to the producer Bunty Walia who had
                    publicised the film with him on the cover. Later in December 2017, it was announced that he was
                    signed in by Abhishek Chaubey, the director of Udta Punjab for his next film titled Sonchiriya,
                    where he would star alongside Bhumi Pednekar.

                    <br>
                    On 2 May 2018, Rajput was inducted as a partner in a company named Innsaei Ventures, which was
                    founded on 26 April 2018; following which he was appointed as one of its three directors, the others
                    being Varun Mathur and Saurabh Mishra. Rajput and Mathur were credited as the co-founders and set to
                    make an investment of ₹300 crore (equivalent to ₹401 crore or US$50 million in 2023) in the company.
                    The company was named Innsaei after the Icelandic word for Institution and marketed as working in
                    the fields related to intellectual property and emerging technologies. Within a week, he was signed

                    promotion of the BHIM mobile payment app. Subsequently, Innsaei Ventures set up a fund of ₹20 crore
                    (equivalent to ₹27 crore or US$3.4 million in 2023) in favour of the Women Entrepreneurship
                    Platform. In the same year, Rajput announced the first creative product of Innsaei Ventures, a 12
                    biopic series where he would play the roles of various Indian historical characters between the
                    years of 540 BC to 2015 CE.
